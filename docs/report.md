# Single-Pile Nim: General report

This week's work introduced:

* a new instruction
* the concept of writing subroutines
* new ways of using the CARDIAC to build and store instructions

Respond to the following prompts about the programs illustrating these concepts.

## In your own words, describe the shift instruction. Why might this instruction exist?

`TODO`

## We described subroutines as _like_ functions. In what ways are they similar or different?

`TODO`

## Memory Cell 99 has a special purpose. What is it? When can we use it? When can't we?

`TODO`

## We discovered that the CARDIAC can also build instructions. How is this consistent or inconsistent with our understanding of _data words_ and/or _instruction words_?

`TODO`

## Provide a flowchart of your final `nim.cardiac` process; you might draw this up _before_ you solve it.

HINT: It will help.
